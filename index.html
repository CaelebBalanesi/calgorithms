    <h4>History</h4>
    <p>Boids were developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986 and published in 1987. The concept was created to simulate the flocking behavior of bird-like objects, which inspired their name. Boids are closely related to a <a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/suisan1932/48/8/48_8_1081/_article">paper</a> written by Ichiro Aoki five years earlier, which explored the schooling behavior of fish. Both models use similar mechanisms that, when properly adjusted, produce group movement. The key interest in boids lies in the fact that none of the individual 'birds' have knowledge of each other's actions. The emergent behavior arises solely from the simple rules each boid follows in response to its neighbors.</p>
    <h4>Model</h4>
    <p>The flocking behavior is an emergent behavior from the simple rules of the boid model. The model in its simplest form has three main rules:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Separation</b>: Dont get too close to neighbors</li>
      <li><b>Alignment</b>: Fly in the same direction as neighbors</li>
      <li><b>Cohesion</b>: Get to the average position of neighbors</li>
    </ol>
    <p>With these simple rules this simple flocking behavior emerges.</p>

    <h4>Extensions</h4>
    <p>There are many extensions to the boid model that can be added to enhance the flocking behavior with more interesting behaviors.</p>
